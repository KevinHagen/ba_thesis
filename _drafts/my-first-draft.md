Drafts are very useful to store blog posts on the webserver until they're ready. Everything that is a draft is not simply accessible but still pushed to the hosted server, so that one can see how it looks and feels.
Nice!
All you need to do is create a .md file in a _drafts folder and start jekyll using jekyll serve --draft
