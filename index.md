## Welcome to my bachelor thesis!

This website is going to host a complete web-version of my thesis. For now, there are only some interactive demos, which are used in the thesis. 

If you prefer reading a .pdf file, feel free to download one of the following:

- [English version](https://github.com/KevinHagen/KHollapse/)
- [German version](https://github.com/KevinHagen/KHollapse/)

To view the source code of the demos browse this [repository](https://github.com/KevinHagen/KHollapse/). You can find the source code of each demo there, but there is also going to be a link to a demos specific code on its own page, so you don't have to come back here if you want to look at e.g. the code for CA.
